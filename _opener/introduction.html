headline: 'Code for America Five Years In'
description: "<p>We’re on a mission to make government work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. When we launched this experiment in 2009, no one believed that government wanted to do things differently. We started by pairing talented technologists with local governments to build interfaces with government that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use. From that nascent beginning, a network of dedicated people who believed change was possible emerged. There is now so much enthusiasm to transform government services, we can’t keep up with the demand. </p>\n<p>In 2014, we hit an important milestone, moving from work primarily focused on showing what’s possible when you apply user-centered, data-driven, iterative approaches to government practices to deepening impact around key outcomes in health, economic development, and safety and justice. In learning how to take what we’ve done and continue build upon on it, we spent 2014 strengthening partnerships; made key team hires in tech, focus areas, and content; and advanced key programs including the Fellowship, the volunteer Brigade network, and the Summit.</p>\n<p>As we celebrate Code for America five years in, our widening network of talented, dedicated people is changing tools and platforms, transitioning people and practices, and deepening impact on government digital services.</p><p>It’s only with the dedicated hand raising of thousands of citizens, communities, and supporters, that we’ve reached where we are today. We hope even more hands will continue to join in.</p>\n<p>In gratitude,<br />\nJennifer Pahlka<br />\nFounder and Executive Director, Code for America</p>"
