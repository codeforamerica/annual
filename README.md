Design

This project uses Sass for its stylesheets. Make visual adjustments to the .scss files and compile with Compass. Traverse into your project directory and:

    compass watch

Sass files are automatically compiled because Compass will watch the project directory for changes. Design, test, iterate, repeat. When complete:

    compass compile -e production
