quote: 'We made the pre-Kindergarten application process electronic so parents only had to fill out one form, even if they entered into four pre-k lotteries. And we took away all the data entry that the schools had to do. School administrators wrote back, ‘woo-hoo!’ But most importantly, Golden Ticket was included in a Federal grant application to expand pre-K offerings to help demonstrate the state’s capacity to handle more registrations, and they won the grant!'
