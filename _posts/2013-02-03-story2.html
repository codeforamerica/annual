              <p>The City of Oakland receives a huge volume of public records requests. Although City staff 
              strove to respond quickly,their existing system made it difficult to track outstanding inquiries and often created duplicate work. The tool and the process was frustrating for both residents and staff. As a result, tensions arose between the community and the City over request compliance.</p><br>
              <p>The 2013 Fellows built RecordTrac to streamline this
              process &mdash; for residents and city employees. The tool offers three key services: a searchable archive of past requests and responses, a simple form to make new requests, and updates about the status of a request. More than 2,000 requests were submitted through RecordTrac by year's end.
              </p><br>
              <p>By bringing transparency to the system, saving city staff time, and improving responses, RecordTrac
              is repairing the relationship between residents and City Hall around transparency and public information.</p>
