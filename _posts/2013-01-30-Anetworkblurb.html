      <h3>WE ARE A NETWORK</h3>
      <p>Thousands of citizens and dozens of cities are connected through Code for America. 
      The number of volunteer Brigade chapters in the U.S. more than doubled, with nearly 3,000 members, 
      and the Peer Network of government officials is now active in 50+ cities. Beyond our shores,
      we launched our first international program, Code for All. This network is a platform
      for sharing what works and what doesnâ€™t, scaling innovation virally, and replicating technology
      around the world.</p>
