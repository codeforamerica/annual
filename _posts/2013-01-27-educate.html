      <h3>WE ARE COLLABORATING</h3>
      <p>Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking citizens and public servants across the country
      are leveraging technology to change the way our cities work &mdash; and it’s accelerated by an exchange
      of ideas, best practice solutions, and even software code.</p>
      <p>In 2013 we facilitated this conversation through our programs, events, educational content,
      and tech projects. We trained city officials in techniques like lean thinking and
      user-centered design &mdash; and watched them take it back and change the way they do their jobs.
      Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and creating innovation offices; they're redeploying each
      other’s apps; and they're working together to take on common policy challenges like procurement and HR practices.</p>

          <h4>REWIRING GOVERNMENT</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>We’ve seen a dramatic pick up of our model across the country
          and around the world. The White House borrowed both Code for America's model and founder &mdash; establishing
          the Presidential Innovation Fellowship
          and appointing Jennifer Pahlka as the U.S. Deputy CTO for Government Innovation. Our international partners
          launched Fellowships and Brigades,
          and the City of San Francisco now has both Mayor’s Innovation Fellows and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence.
          In 2013, 
          our work led to the creation of 13 new innovation positions in city halls.</p>

          <h4>SUPPORTING NEW SKILLS</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Code for America helps governments understand and build modern
          skill sets through trainings, resources, and one-on-one support.
          Our Peer Network hosts monthly webinars on topics ranging from data-driven policy making to GitHub
          for government. Our fellows work hand-in-hand with their local partners to assess needs and fill gaps. And by
          showcasing what’s
          working in individual cities, we’re helping to establish new standards for civic innovation.</P>

          <h4>ADVANCING OPEN DATA</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>
          Government data is only useful when it's made available to the public and integrated with the websites
          people use everyday. In 2013, Code for America worked to make this standard practice. We walked cities
          through the process of passing an open data policy,
          deploying a data portal, and releasing data in standardized formats. Chicago’s former Chief Data Officer, Brett Goldstein, and Code for America's Lauren Dyson
          co-edited Beyond Transparency, an anthology of public data experts. In total, we inspired the creation
          of 30 new local government policies to support innovation and established three new civic data
          specifications.</p>
