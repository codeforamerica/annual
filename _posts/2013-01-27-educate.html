		  <h3>Facilitating Collaboration Between Civic Leaders</h3>
		  <p>Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking citizens and public servants across the country are leveraging technology to change the way our cities work &mdash; and it’s accelerated by an exchange of ideas, solutions, best practices, and even software code between like-minded leaders. <br><br>In 2013 we led this conversation through our programs, annual conference, educational content, and collaborative tech projects. We exposed city officials to ideas like lean thinking and user-centered design &mdash; and watched them take it back and change they way they do their jobs. Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and creating innovation offices; they're redeploying each other’s apps; and they're working together to take on common policy challenges. </p>

                <p>This year's Summit was bigger than ever. With 500+ passionate people gathering for three days of collaborative thinking, reflection, and ideation, there was more momentum and energy than before. Although there were 80+ local governments represented, along with folks from our partners in seven other countries, and civic leaders from coast-to-coast, the event was able to retain the intimate community feeling of previous years &mdash; a feeling of friends and colleagues coming together to share their passion and hope for a better America.</p>

                <p>A joint project co-edited by Chicago’s former Chief Data Officer, Brett Goldstein, and CfA's Lauren Dyson, Beyond Transparency is a cross-disciplinary survey of the open data landscape featuring practitioners who share their exterpise and stories about their accomplishments using open civic data. The book seeks to move beyond the rhetoric of transparency for transparency’s sake and towards action and problem solving.</p>

                <p>Governments gather massive amounts of valuable data. But data is only useful when it's made available to the public, and integrated with the apps and websites people already use everyday. This year Code for America led the collaborative creation of three new civic data standards. One of these, LIVES, made restaurant inspection data readily available to diners &mdash; by putting it on Yelp.</p>
