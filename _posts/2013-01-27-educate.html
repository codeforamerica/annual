      <h3>WE ARE COLLABORATING</h3>
      <p>Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking citizens and public servants across the country
      are leveraging technology to change the way our cities work &mdash; and it’s accelerated by an exchange
      of ideas, solutions, best practices, and even software code.</p>
      <p>In 2013 we facilitated this conversation through our programs, events, educational content,
      and tech projects. We exposed city officials to ideas like lean thinking and
      user-centered design &mdash; and watched them take it back and change the way they do their jobs.
      Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and creating innovation offices; they're redeploying each
      other’s apps; and they're working together to take on common policy challenges.</p>

          <h4>REWIRING GOVERNMENT</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>We’ve seen a dramatic pick up of our model across the country
          and around the world. The White House borrowed both Code for America's model and founder &mdash; establishing the Presidential Innovation Fellowship
          and appointing Jennifer Pahlka as the U.S. Deputy CTO for Government Innovation. Our international partners launched Fellowships and Brigades,
          and the City of San Francisco now has both Mayor’s Innovation Fellows and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence. In 2013, 
          our work led to the creation of 13 new innovation positions in city halls.</p>

          <h4>SUPPORTING NEW SKILLS</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Code for America offers city employees trainings and resources to build modern government skill sets. 
          Supported by workshops, webinars, guides, and one-on-one support, governments are learning user experience design,
          data­-driven policy making, and lean startup techniques. And by showcasinge what’s
          working in individual cities, we’re helping to establish the new standards for civic innovation.</P>

          <h4>ADVANCING OPEN DATA</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>
          Government data is only useful when it's made available
          to the public, and integrated with the apps and websites people use everyday. This year, Code
          for America walked cities through the process of passing an open data policy, deployed open data portals,
          and led the creation of three new civic data standards. Chicago’s former Chief Data Officer,
          Brett Goldstein, and Code for America's Lauren Dyson co-edited Beyond Transparency, an anthology of public data experts. In 2013, our work inspired the creation 30 new rules or policies to support innovation in local government.</p>
