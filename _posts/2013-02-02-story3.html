            <p>Everyday governments gather massive amounts of data, about everything from building safety to
            restaurant cleanliness.</p>
            <p>In 2013 Code for America made restaurant inspection data readily available to diners &mdash; by putting
            it on Yelp. We work with both goverment staff and the Yelp team to create a standardized
            format for this data, called LIVES.  </p>
            <p>Now any city that releases their restaurant
            inspections in this format can see it on Yelp's restaurant profile pages. Currently, four cities have
            done so: Louisville, San Francisco, Wake County, and x. These cities are giving residents information to keep their
            families healthy &mdash; and hopefully encouraging restaurants everywhere to keep their kitchens clean.</p>
            <p>It's making public data useful by showing it to citizens at the point of decision-making &mdash; Where should I go for pad thai? &mdash; 
            rather than buried deep in a city website.</p>
