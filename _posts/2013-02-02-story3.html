            <p>Every day governments gather massive amounts of data, about everything from building safety to
            restaurant cleanliness.</p>
            <p>In 2013 Code for America made restaurant inspection data readily available to diners &mdash; by putting
            it on Yelp. Working with both goverment staff and the Yelp team, Code for America created a standardized
            format for this data, called LIVES.  </p>
            <p>Now any local government that releases their restaurant
            inspections in this format can see it on Yelp's restaurant profile pages. So far, four have
            done so: Los Angeles County, Louisville, San Francisco, and Wake County. These municipalities are giving residents information to help keep their
            families healthy &mdash; and hopefully encouraging restaurants everywhere to keep their kitchens clean.</p>
            <p>LIVES is making public data useful by showing it to citizens when they need it &mdash; Where should I go for pad thai? &mdash; 
            rather than buried deep in a city website.</p>
