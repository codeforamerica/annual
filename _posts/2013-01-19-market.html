			<p class="blurb">The past few decades have seen lightweight web and mobile technology change the world, but the public sector remains saddled with software that is overly-complex, increasingly expensive, and often broken. And with local governments in fiscal crisis, these outdated systems are breaking the bank.</p>
			<p class="blurb">But there’s a new wave of tech companies who assume that good technology is as easy to use as an iPad &mdash; and that you get more for your dollar every year, not less. The <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/" target="_blank">Code for America Accelerator</a> finds the most innovative, relevant civic startups building tools for government, and provides them business consulting and mentorship, a broad network of potential investors and customers, and a national platform to raise awareness.</p>

					<p>The companies participating in the Accelerator are building businesses by offering governments new technologies that save time and money &mdash; and also help them connect with citizens in new ways. The program amplified their reach with mentorship from key players in the tech industry, $25k in seed funding, and the opportunity to share their products with governments nationwide.</p>
					<p>These are not just thriving companies, but people with incredible entrepreneurial energy and passion.</p>
