            <p>Textizen is helping communities from coast to coast lend a listening ear to residents, students, 
            parents, and individuals everywhere who deserve their say. Just this year Textizen worked with Tampa, FL to ask residents whether or not to add an elevated roadway that would reduce traffic congestion and provide
            evacuation route, worked with Chicago Public Schools to gather input for
            its 10-year Facilities Master Plan, and helped teach the students of Rex Putnam High School in
            Milwaukie, OR about mental illness.</p>

            <p>Born in the 2012 Fellowship and then expanded as a civic startup in 2013 with the support and
            guidance of CfA's Incubator program, Textizen is already making strides in civic tech. The team has
            worked with more than 40 cities and exchanged more than 25,000 text messages.</p>

            <p>Textizen is now available in Spanish and will soon launch a new feature, Campaigns, to keep
            people engaged in ongoing conversation.</p>

              <p><strong>"Iâ€™ve been very pleased with the results. Projects to add lanes on
              Gandy Boulevard have been very controversial locally for more than a decade.  Textizen was
              a great tool to get a quick read on community opinion."</strong><br><em>Beth Alden, Assistant Executive
