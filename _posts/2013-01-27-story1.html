            <p>When you're hungry or homeless or just need some help you need an easy and reliable way to find the food, shelter, or services you need. In San Mateo County residents had to rely on knowledgeable service providers to find out when and how and where to find services -- and services providers had to rely on a paper booklet updated and distributed only once a year. This system not only created a bottle neck for service providers but often resulted in outdated information.<br>
            Working with the San Mateo County Human Services Agency, the Fellows created an app to put the data -- that traditionally populated the paper booked -- into truly helpful, available to all, and up-to-date format: SMC Connect. This app asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" And with that, returns relevant, accurate information. The app is powered by an API, which makes this social service data publicly available to any technologist interested in building another app for the county. The Fellows also standardized the data's format, which is likely to be adopted as a national data specification for municipalities everywhere.<br>The true genius behind this application is that service providers have the ability to update the information about their organization -- so information will stay current and no one ever has to find a shut door or a closed sign.</p>
