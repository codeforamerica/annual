        <p>In 2013, the frustration surrounding the launch of healthcare.gov made it more clear than ever
        that the digital interfaces to government are critical. There’s a pressing need
        for citizens to lead the way, bringing new talent to solve our shared problems.</p>
        
        <p>This year, we saw those leaders step up. Twenty-seven Fellows, hundreds of partners in local
        government, thousands of active volunteers, new international partners, and more than a dozen
        civic startups &mdash; together we found new ways to transform our communities and refine our shared vision
        of what government by the people, for the people means in the 21st century.</p>
        
        <p>We began to explore what it means when interfaces to government are decidedly
        not simple, beautiful, or easy to use: when they stand between you and feeding your family, your
        healthcare, or your child’s education. Fellows working in Louisville and New York City delved into
        the criminal justice system. In the Bay Area, teams tackled access to food assistance and social services. These experiences, and others like them, remind us what’s at stake in our work &mdash; and what's possible. 
        <p>We begin 2014 with a deepened commitment to work on what matters.</p>
        <p>Thank you for all that you do.</p>
