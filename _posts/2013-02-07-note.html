            <p>In 2013, the frustration surrounding the launch of healthcare.gov made it more clear than ever
            that the digital interfaces to government are critical. There’s a pressing need
            for citizens to lead the way, bringing new talent to solve our shared problems.</p>
            
            <p>This year, we saw those leaders step up. Twenty-seven Fellows, hundreds of partners in local
            government, thousands of active volunteers, new international partners, and now more than a dozen
            civic startups &mdash; together we found new ways to transform our communities and refine our shared vision
            of what government by the people, for the people means in the 21st century.</p>
            
            <p>The people in our network began to explore what it means when interfaces to government are decidedly
            not simple, beautiful, or easy to use: when they stand between you and feeding your family, your
            healthcare, or your child’s education. Fellows working in Louisville and New York City delved into
            the criminal justice system. In the Bay Area, teams tackled access to food assistance. And across
            the country, the CfA community addressed real problems facing our cities in the 21st century.</p>
            
            <p>These experiences remind us what’s at stake in our work &mdash; and what's possible. 
            We begin 2014 with a deepened commitment to work on what matters.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for a phenomenal year. We're humbled by the talent and passion of the Code for America
            community, and we hope you enjoy these reflections.</p>
