        <h3>Thousands of citizens and dozens of cities have built a powerful network.</h3>
        <p>We’ve more than doubled the number of volunteer Brigade chapters in the US, with 3,000+ members, and our the Peer Network for government officials is now active in 50+ cities. Beyond our shores, we have launched our first international program, Code for All.
