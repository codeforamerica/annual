      <h3>Thousands of citizens and dozens of cities have built a powerful network.</h3>
      <p>Weâ€™ve more than doubled the number of volunteer Brigade chapters in the US, with 3,000+ members, and our the Peer Network for government officials is now active in 50+ cities. Beyond our shores, we have launched our first international program, Code for All. Together this network is a platform for scaling innovation virally, replicating apps, data standards, and policies across the country.</p>
