            <p>The City of Oakland receives a huge volume of public records requests, but their existing system was confusing for users, led to duplicate work, and made it difficult to track response time and outstanding inquiries. Tensions arose between residents and city staff over compliance with requests, as city employees strove to respond promptly but struggled with the system.<br><br>

            The 2013 Fellows interviewed employees in every city department, from the fire department to IT, before building RecordTrac to streamline this records request process. It offers three key services: a searchable archive of past requests and responses, a simple form to make a new request, and a tool to track the status of a request.<br><br>
            By bringing transparency to the system, saving city staff time and improving responses, RecordTrac is a step to repair the relationship between residents and city hall around sharing public information. Several other cities have already expressed interest in redeploying the application</p>
