            <p>The systems created to help our most vulnerable neighbors don't always operate as well as they could. That's why in 2013, two local government Human Services Agencies (HSA) &mdash; San Francisco and San Mateo County &mdash; partnered with CfA to improve service delivery.</p>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County HSA, a team of Fellows created SMC-Connect, a social services search app that asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" It offers relevant, accurate, and easy-to-access information about local service providers, and replaces an out-of-date and inaccessible paper booklet. Built as a platform, the solution allows service providers to update their own information and invites the creation of other apps.</p>
	    <p>In San Francisco, the fellows learned that the agency was communicating in ways that clients misunderstood or overlooked, with the result that many people inadvertently lost their benefits and had to reapply. Instead, the team built Promptly, a notification system to send clients a text message when their benefits were at risk. Since launch, already half of the users who have received a text notification have been able to avoid the frustrating experience of losing their assistance. Despite the wide use of cellphones in our society, the HSA was the first SF agency to text their clients.</p>
	    <p>Now teams of 2013 fellows are working to scale these tools around the country.</p>
