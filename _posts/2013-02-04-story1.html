            <p>When you're hungry or homeless, or just need some help, it's essential to have an easy 
            and reliable way to find food, shelter, and services. San Mateo County residents often had 
            to rely on knowledgeable service providers to find assistance &mdash; and those service providers had to 
            rely on a paper booklet updated and distributed just once a year. This system not only created a bottleneck,
            but often resulted in dissemination of outdated information.</p><br>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County Human Services Agency, the Fellows created an app to put this data &mdash; 
            before shared via the paper booklet &mdash; into a truly helpful, available to all, and up-to-date
            format: <a href="http://www.smc-connect.org/" target="_blank">SMC Connect</a>. This app asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" and returns relevant,
            accurate information. SMC Connect is powered by an API, making this social service data publicly available
            to any technologist interested in building another app for the county. The Fellows also standardized the
            data's format, which is likely to be adopted as a national data specification for municipalities everywhere.</p><br>
            <p>SMC Connect also enables service providers to update the 
            information about their organization themselves, so information will stay current and no one ever has to 
            arrive at a "Closed" sign.</p>

              <p><strong>"If you look at what Code for America Fellows did elsewhere, it involved some of the big,
              hairy, audacious goals of government. But they reached them just by bringing in fresh eyes and adopting
              a simple, easy-to-use approach."</strong><br><em> Beverly Beasley Johnson,<br> Director of the San Mateo
              County Human Services Agency</em></p>
