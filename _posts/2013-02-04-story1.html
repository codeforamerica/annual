            <p>The systems created to help our most vulnerable neighbors don't always operate as well as they could. That's why two local government Human Services Agencies (HSA) &mdash; City of San Francisco and San Mateo County &mdash; partnered with Code for America to improve service delivery.</p>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County HSA, a team of Fellows created SMC-Connect, a social services search app that asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" It offers relevant, accurate, and easy-to-access information about local service providers, replacing an out-of-date and inaccessible paper booklet. Built as a platform, SMC-Connect allows service providers to update their own information and invites the creation of other apps.</p>
	    <p>In San Francisco, Fellows learned that the agency was communicating in ways that clients misunderstood or overlooked, which resulted in numerous people inadvertently losing their benefits and having to enroll yet again. To fix the cycle, the team built Promptly, a notification system to send clients a text message when their benefits were at risk. Since launch, already half of the users who have received a text notification have been able to avoid losing their food assistance. Despite the wide use of cellphones in our society, the HSA was the first San Francisco agency to text their clients.</p>
	    <p>In 2014, Fellows will work to scale these tools around the country.</p>
