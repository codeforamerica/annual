            <p>Outdated and inefficient government systems take the greatest toll on the vulnerable individuals who most rely on social services. That's why in 2013, two local government Human Services Agencies (HSA)&mdash;San Francisco and San Mateo&mdash;partnered with CfA to deliver better services for those most in need.</p>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County HSA, a team of Fellows created SMC Connect, an app that asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" Replacing an out-of-date and inaccessible paper booklet, the app offers relevant, accurate, and easy-to-access information about local service providers. Built as a platform, the solution also enables the creation of other apps&mdash;such as a SMS search tools and mobile apps&mdash;all of which can easibly reused in communities with open social services data.</p>
            <p>In SF, the team of fellows learned that historically agencies have communicated in ways that were too often misunderstood or overlooked. Instead, the team built Promptly, an SMS notification system to alert clients their benefits were at risk, making SF HSA the first agency to text their  clients. Since launch, already half of the users were able to avoid the frustrating experience of losing their assistance.</p>
            <p>Now teams of 2013 fellows are working to scale these tools around the country.</p><br>

              <p><strong>"If you look at what Code for America Fellows did elsewhere, it involved some of the big,
              hairy, audacious goals of government. But they reached them just by bringing in fresh eyes and adopting
              a simple, easy-to-use approach."</strong><br><em> Beverly Beasley Johnson,<br> Director of the San Mateo
